If you are a software engineer or a programmer you must have used stackoverflow atleast once in your life time. But have you ever wondered how stackoverflow predicts the tags for a given question ? In this blog, I will discuss about stackoverflow tag predictor case study.

<h1> Business Problem </h1>

Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their programming knowledge, and build their careers.

Stack Overflow is something which every programmer use one way or another. Each month, over 50 million developers come to Stack Overflow to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. The website serves as a platform for users to ask and answer questions, and, through membership and active participation, to vote questions and answers up or down and edit questions and answers in a fashion similar to a wiki or Digg. As of April 2014 Stack Overflow has over 4,000,000 registered users, and it exceeded 10,000,000 questions in late August 2015. Based on the type of tags assigned to questions, the top eight most discussed topics on the site are: Java, JavaScript, C#, PHP, Android, jQuery, Python and HTML.

## Problem Statement
Predict the tags ( keywords, topics, summaries), given only the question text and its title.

# Business Objectives and Constraints
- Predict as many tags as possible with high [precision and recall](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/performance-metrics-for-machine-learning-models-80d7666b432e).
- Incorrect tags could impact customer experience on StackOverflow.
- No strict latency constraints.

# Machine Learning Problem

## Data

1. Data contains 4 fields

2. Id - Unique identifier for each question

3. Title - The questionâ€™s title

4. Body - The body of the question

5. Tags - The tags associated with the question

Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction/data) for more details.

All of the data is in 2 files: Train and Test.<br />
<pre>
<b>Size of Train.csv</b> - 6.75GB<br />
<b>Size of Test.csv</b> - 2GB<br />
<b>Number of rows in Train.csv</b> = 6034195<br />
</pre>
The questions are randomized and contains a mix of verbose text sites as well as sites related to math and programming. The number of questions from each site may vary, and no filtering has been performed on the questions (such as closed questions).<br />

## Mapping the Business problem to a Machine Learning Problem

It is a multi-label classification problem.

In Multi-label Classification, multiple labels (in this problem its tags) may be assigned to each instance and there is no constraint on how many of the classes the instance can be assigned to. Source: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-label_classification)

Find more about multi-label classification problem [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html)

A question on Stackoverflow might be about any of C, Pointers, JAVA, Regex, FileIO and/or memory-management at the same time or none of these.

Performance metric
1. Micro F1 score
2. Macro F1 score

Please read this [blog](https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/HammingLoss) to know more about metrics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

I have used pandas library to load the data. Please visit My [github](https://github.com/Sachin-D-N/Stack_overflow_Tag_Prediction/blob/main/Stack_Overflow_Tag_Predictor/Stack_Overflow_Tag_Predictor.ipynb) repo to see the full code. I have taken a sample of 1000000 (10 lakh) data points from Train.csv. Here is a list of major observations from EDA.
